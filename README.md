How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? I have learned how to draw shapes, apply textures and colors, camera movement, and lighting.
What design process did you follow for your project work? I followed the assignment instructions.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? The same steps could be used for any similar project.
How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? All of these principles were new to me.
How did iteration factor into your development? While I was completing the coding I would periodically run the project to see what changes I was making.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? My approach to coding is about the same as it was when I started this project.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? These skills can be used to enhance presentations and projects.
